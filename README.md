# Multitenant-Store
A multi-tenant e-commerce backend built with Django and DRF, supporting multiple vendors on a single platform. Each vendor manages their own products, orders, staff, and customers with complete data isolation. Features include JWT authentication, role-based access, order management, and tenant-aware APIs.
